I am currently a Master student at Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Lijing Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XzerSxgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research focuses on **understanding the oceanâ€™s role in a changing climate based on observation**. My interests are wide-ranging and include, but are not limited to: 
- Earth's energy flow and water cycle,
- Contemporary sea level budget,
- Atlantic meridional heat and freshwater transport.
